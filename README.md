# 3D-CROSSWORD-PUZZLE
How to compile the program: 
Type "javac *.java" on the command line. Make sure directory is the same one as the one in which all the .java files for this program are contained (Crossword.java, Word.java and Pair.java).

How to run the program:
Type "java Crossword <(.txt file with words and definitions)" onto the command line. This program is meant to take in a .txt file as its input, but it its current state it has no output. The .txt file must be in the format: "Word : Definition" for each line in order for the program to work correctly. For testing, the file "words.txt" has been included in this zipped folder. 

How to use the program:
Currently, the program only generates the crossword grid and prints it out. Our next step will be to display this crossword graphically and allow user input for its completion. Finally, we will add functionality to map it onto and display it on a 3D cube.
